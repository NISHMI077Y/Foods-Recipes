                <h3>What is healthy eating?</h3>
                <p>Healthy eating is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about eating well-balanced meals that leave you feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.

                    Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most important. Eating well involves eating more foods that are closer to the way nature made them. This can make a huge difference in how you think, look, and feel.
                    
                    By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.

                <h3>How to make vegetable tasty..</h3>
                <p>While plain salads and steamed veggies can quickly become bland, there are plenty of ways to add taste to your vegetable dishes.

                    Add color. Not only do brighter, deeper colored vegetables contain higher concentrations of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but they can vary the flavor and make meals more visually appealing. Add color using fresh or sundried tomatoes, glazed carrots or beets, roasted red cabbage wedges, yellow squash, or sweet, colorful peppers.
                    
                    Liven up salad greens. Branch out beyond lettuce. Kale, arugula, spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage are all packed with nutrients. To add flavor to your salad greens, try drizzling with olive oil, adding a spicy dressing, or sprinkling with almond slices, chickpeas, a little bacon, parmesan, or goat cheese.
                    
                    Cook green beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus in new ways. Instead of boiling or steaming these healthy sides, try grilling, roasting, or pan frying them with chili flakes, garlic, shallots, mushrooms, or onion. Or marinate in tangy lemon or lime before cooking.

                <h3>Probiotics</h3>
                <p>What are probiotics?
                    Probiotics is an umbrella term for the types of beneficial live microorganisms (or microbes) found in products such as fermented foods and yogurt. When consumed, probiotics can contribute microbes to the number that naturally live in your gut and elsewhere. This community of all microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, is known as the microbiome.
                    
                    Recent research focuses on how changes in the microbiome might result in health benefits. For example, healthier microorganisms can improve your digestion and immune response. In turn, this may prevent conditions such as periodontal disease and constipation, and ease the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
                    
                    But the health benefits of probiotics aren’t limited to your gut. Probiotics may also help to improve your heart health, mood, skin, and cognitive functioning, as well as counteract the negative effects of antibiotics. Probiotics could even potentially play a role in managing diabetes and types of cancer and dementia.
                    
                    If you’re curious about probiotics but feel unsure of how to incorporate them into your eating habits, know that you won’t need to turn your diet upside down to get started. Making simple changes can go a long way toward helping you attain better health and boost your sense of well-being.

                <h3>Healthy snacks for Teens</h3>
                <p> Whether it's contending with a near-insatiable appetite, skipping breakfast, or choosing unhealthy snacks, navigating healthy food choices can be a challenge for teens. In between mealtimes, it can be tempting to reach for quick fixes in the form of refined carbohydrates and sugar-laden snacks, but it doesn't have to be that way – having a stash of healthy snacks on hand can be especially useful when hunger strikes between meals.

            <h1>Rosemary, Garlic & Chillipopcorn<h1>
            <p>Popcorn is a teen favourite, and with good reason – it's the perfect accompaniment to a movie night but is equally as delicious packed up in a storage container for an on-the-go nibble. Try this savoury flavour combination for a low-sugar option – we've used garlic and rosemary, and you can vary the chilli levels to please your teenager's palate.</p>

            <h1>Smocky veggie nacho<h1></h1>
            <p>This sharing platter of nachos is still a super-healthy option – and as it serves six, the whole family will be able to tuck in! This Mexican-inspired dish provides folate, fibre and vitamin C, along with plenty of flavour. We've opted to top paprika-sprinkled crispy tortillas with black beans, charred peppers, and a fresh tomato and avocado salsa. Delicious.</p>

            <h1>Egg & Rocket pizzas</h1>
            <p>Eggs are a filling, plant-based source of protein – ideal for veggie teens. In this recipe, we've used seeded tortilla wraps as cheat's pizza bases, topped with a simple tomato and pepper sauce and an egg, cracked into the centre – it makes for a lovely light lunch or substantial snack, and is easy enough for teenagers to make for themselves<p>

            <h1>Ultimate tomato salsa</h1>
            <p>Only have five minutes? No problem. This speedy salsa combines tomatoes, red onions, garlic, white wine vinegar, lime and coriander to make a delicious dip that you can store in the fridge. Serve with crunchy crudités or toasted pitta bread – opt for wholemeal for a gut-friendly fibre boost.<p>

            <h1>Indian style oven chips</h1>
            <p>Spice up your snack with these Indian-style potato wedges, flavoured with turmeric, ginger, fennel seeds and cayenne pepper and oven-baked until crisp and golden. If you wanted to bump up the fibre to create a more filling snack, leave the potato skins on.<p>

            <h1>Healthy banana bread</h1>
            <p>This low-fat loaf not only tastes great, but uses up those overripe bananas in your fruit bowl. We've used a blend of self-raising and wholemeal flour to increase the fibre content while keeping the texture light, and topped with chopped nuts for extra texture (you can leave these out if you'd prefer). It's a satisfying snack any teen will love – and it's easy enough for them to have a go at making themselves!<p>
