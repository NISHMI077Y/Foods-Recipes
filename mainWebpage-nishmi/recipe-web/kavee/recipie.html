<h2>Butter Naan</h2>
<p>This delicious and healthy Indian foodrecipe.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-naan">What is Butter Naan?</h2>
<p>Naan is a leavened flatbread made in some countries in Asia.It is look like a Shavarma. It is also popular in India and almost all the restaurants in sri lanka.</p>
<br><br>
<h2><strong>How to make Butter Naan</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li> In a mixing bowl take ¼ cup fresh curd or yogurt. For a vegan naan, use almond or cashew yogurt. </li>
<li>Add 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1 pinch baking soda.</li>
<li>With a spoon mix all the ingredients very well till the sugar dissolves.</li>
<li>Mix again with a spoon so that the salt is evenly distributed in the flour.</li>
<li>Make a well in the center and add 2 tablespoons oil. Note that you can even add butter instead of oil. Use any neutral-flavored oil.</li>
<li>Add ¼ to ⅓ cup water or add as required.</li>
<li>Knead to a smooth and soft dough. If the curd is thick, then you may need to add more water. In case the dough looks dry, then add some more water and knead.

If it becomes sticky, then sprinkle some flour and knead again. You should get a soft stretchy dough. You can even use a stand mixer to knead the dough.</li>
<li> Flatten the dough. You can even spread some oil all over the dough if you want. Place in the same bowl.</li>
<li>Place a moist kitchen towel or napkin completely covering on the dough. Cover the bowl with a lid and let the dough leaven for 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2><strong>Rolling naan bread</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make medium-sized balls from the dough.</li>
<li>Flatten slightly and sprinkle some flour on the dough as well as on the rolling board.</li>
<li>Sprinkle some onion seeds or sesame seeds (black or white) or melon seeds on the rolled dough.</li>
<li>Roll into a 6 to 7 inches elongated circle.</li>
<li>Roll the top side to get a tapering edge. You can even gently pull the dough with your hands to get this pointed edge. The naan will have a tear-shaped form.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h2><strong>Making naan on stove-top</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Keep the flame to medium-high or high and begin to cook the naan bread.</li>
<li>Let one side get partly cooked. You will see some air pockets on the naan.</li>
When you start seeing the air-pockets, then flip.
<li>Now cook the second side on medium-high to high flame.</li>
<li>Again you will see air-pockets appearing on the second side.</li>
<li>Flip when you see many air-pockets on the naan and place naan directly on the stovetop flame.</li>
<li>Grill the first side on the flame till you see some charred spots and blisters.</li>
<li>Also, roast the edges.</li>
<li>Turn over and roast the second side too till you see some charred spots.</li>

Place it on a plate or tray. Spread or brush with some softened butter or melted butter. You can even use ghee </ol>
